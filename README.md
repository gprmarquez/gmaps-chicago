# gmaps-chicago

This project was to be used for marking places that I have eaten in Chicago, IL! It is currently on pause because I do not want to put a billing method on my Google Cloud Project even though it is free.

## Technologies Used:
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [GoogleMap API](https://developers.google.com/maps/)

The repo has everything needed to get started with the map, but you must have your own Google API Key.

## Run it locally!
1. Fork or clone the repository on your preferred Code Editor!
    <br>`git clone https://github.com/gprmarquez/gmaps-chicago.git`
2. Navigate into the cloned folder.
3. Run `yarn`. This should install the dependencies in the package.json file.
4. Run `yarn start` to get the program running!
5. Enjoy the unfinished map to Chicago!
